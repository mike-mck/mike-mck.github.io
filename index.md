## Hi, I'm Michael McKelligott!

I am a PhD student at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. I consider myself an applied microeconomist investigating questions at the intersection of public policy and economics, often in the context of late nineteenth/early twentieth century America.

### About My Work
- Investigating the spread of Germ Theory knowledge and its effects on mortality.
- Studying the role of local newspapers in shaping public health responses.
- Evaluating the long-term economic consequences of hygiene campaigns.
