I am a PhD student at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. I work as an applied microeconomist investigating questions at the intersection of health, labor, and political economy, often in the context of late nineteenth/early twentieth century America.

### About My Work

My current research explores the spread of public health knowledge and its impact on private and public decision making and health outcomes. I also explore interactive effects with hygienic infrastrucure and innovate on methods useful in text classification problems. A separate strand of my research investigates the onset of the most generous social insurance program in modern history -- Workmen's Compensation -- and implications for widows and children of recently deceased miners.

### Fields
