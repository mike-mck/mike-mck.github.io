        <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Michael McKelligott</strong>. I am an applied microeconomist generally interested in how people and governments make decisions as well as their implications. I am generally fascinated by the 1880-1920 period in U.S. history, especially the efforts taken to rigorously collect and secure data that we still use to learn interesting things about the world today. </p>
