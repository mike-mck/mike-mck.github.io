        <h1>Hi there!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is <strong>Michael McKelligott</strong>. I am an applied microeconomist generally interested in how people and governments make decisions and their implications. 
            I am especially fascinated by the 1880-1920 period in U.S. history, focusing on the efforts taken to rigorously collect and secure data that we still use today to learn interesting things about the world.
