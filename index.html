        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Michael McKelligott and I am PhD student at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. I consider myself an applied microeconomist that investigates questions at the intersection of public policy and economics, often in the context of late nineteenth/early twentieth century America. I am especially fascinated by the U.S. mortality transition and incredible efforts made to collect and preserve detailed data during this period.

A little about me: I dropped out of college after my first year at Montana State University. I returned to study at Gallatin Community College a year later, where I took Economics 101 en route to my Associates of Arts degree. Needless to say, the class had a profound impact, and I am eternally grateful for the people that supported and guided me every step of the way.

In my free time, I enjoy fly fishing, snowboarding, cooking, music, and coffee!
